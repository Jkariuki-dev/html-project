       <h2> About Me </h2>     
        <p  >I am fascinated by coding. It’s everywhere! Every single one of the digital experiences we enjoy is the result of code. But honestly, I know almost nothing about how it works or how the people behind the code — software engineers — do what they do. Coming from a communication background, I was inspired to be at the forefront of creating programs that communicate between man machine. My ultimate goal is to bring technology closer to people and especially the marginalized in the society.
